Emacs Config
============

This is my Emacs configuration files.
Far from the best, but it's usable and has some pretty nice things in it.

After cloning the repo, to use my files, just run the following commands:

```
ln -s ~/projects/emacs-config/.emacs .emacs
ln -s ~/projects/emacs-config/.emacs.d .emacs.d
```
